                <p>Born into a humble family, Dr. Kalam's upbringing was marked by hard work and curiosity. His early

                <h3>Childhood and Early Life</h3>
                <p>Dr. Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in a modest Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.
                    His
                    father, Jainulabdeen, was a boat owner and imam at a local mosque, and his mother, Ashiamma, was a
                    homemaker. Despite facing financial struggles, young Kalam was a bright and hardworking student. He
                    distributed newspapers to support his family while continuing his education. His curiosity and
                    interest in
                    science and aeronautics shaped his future path. He was deeply influenced by his teachers and
                    developed an
                    early fascination with flight and engineering. His simple upbringing and values of humility and hard
                    work
                    stayed with him throughout his life.</p>

            <section class="background">
                <h3>🎓 Education</h3>
                <p>Dr. Kalam completed his schooling at Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram. He was an
                    average
                    student but had a strong desire to learn and excel. He pursued a degree in Physics at St. Joseph's
                    College,
                    Tiruchirappalli, graduating in 1954. Later, he enrolled in the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT)
                    to study
                    Aerospace Engineering, where he displayed exceptional dedication and a keen interest in aircraft
                    design and
                    technology.</p>
                <p>At MIT, Dr. Kalam faced the challenge of designing an aircraft model as part of his final year
                    project. His
                    professors recognized his brilliance and encouraged his innovative ideas. This period cemented his
                    ambition
                    to
                    work on advanced aeronautics and space technologies, leading to his future role in shaping India's
                    missile
                    and
                    space programs.</p>

                <h3>🚀 Dream of Becoming a Pilot</h3>
                <p>During his time at the Madras Institute of Technology, Dr. Kalam had a deep ambition to become a
                    fighter
                    pilot in the Indian Air Force. Despite his hard work and passion, he narrowly missed the
                    opportunity,
                    securing the ninth position while only eight spots were available. Though disappointed, this setback
                    did not
                    deter him. Instead, it fueled his commitment to contribute to the nation's scientific progress.</p>
